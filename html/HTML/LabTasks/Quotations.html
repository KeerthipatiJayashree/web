    <h1>Using Quotations and Citation Tags in Html</h1>
    <dt>Here is a famous quote by Albert Einstein:</dt>
    <dd>"Life is a bicycle.To keep your balance, we should keep moving."</dd>
    <p>In this context of discussion one might say:</p>
    <p>"To keep your balance, you must keep moving."</p>
    <p>This quote is widely attributed to <em>Albert Einstein</em></p>
    <p>In literary studies we need to cite resources properly.For example,if you're referencing a famous work like <i>pride and prejudice</i> 
    <br>by Jane Austen,you should always inclide author's name to give proper credit.</p>
    <p>Another classic example can be seen in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i><br>
    by William Shakespere, where we love and tragedy interwine to create timeless story.</p>
